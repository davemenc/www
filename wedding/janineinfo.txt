OK we finally nailed down the details for the wedding.

Itinerary:
11am- Set-up party- video games will be provided
6pm- Bride and groom will leave to get ready
8pm- Wedding ceremony with reception to follow

Location- Swiss Park 5911 Mowry Ave, Newark, CA 94560

Recommended Hotel- Comfort Inn & Suites 5977 Mowry Ave, Newark, CA 94560

Passphrase- JanineAndJason (if you didn't already pick one already)

For the registry page-
In lieu of presents, we ask that you bring food or drink to share. We will be providing pizza, soda and water. Please DO NOT bring ANY kind of alcoholic beverages as this would be a violation of our host's liqueur license.

We will also accept any donations to our honeymoon fund that you wish to make.

For RSVP-
In addition to asking name and number of guests I would also like to know what they plan on bringing (if anything) for the potluck, just to try and make sure not everyone brings the same kind of things.

I attached a picture of Swiss Park in case you need it. I also need to know what the url is. I remember you saying menconi.com/wedding but I forgot it exactly. Let me know if I forgot anything.

Love,
Janine
