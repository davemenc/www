			<em><strong>&raquo;Name Tags</strong></em>

			<em><strong>(Category: Laser)</strong></em>
			<p>When we moved into a new building at Playstation we did not get new name tags right away. I wanted to create something unique and compelling and, well, better than</br> 
			Facilities would come up with (petty motives cause us to excel more often than we like to think).</br>
			I designed name tags to be cut out of wood for people. I got the (correctly spelled) name of every person in the office and did a custom design for their names.</br>
			I had to try a few things. First off, what designs look best in wood? I decide in a script font with the letters unetched and the background etched deeply.</br> 
			The result, eventually, was about 50 wooden name tags. Then the question was, "How to attache them?" Ultimately, we ended up gluing very strong magnets to the back</br>
			and then, on glass, putting other strong magnets on the other side of the glass.</br>
			On other surfaces we would attache them on some ferrous metal.</br>
			Everyone seemed to be very pleased with their name tags even to the extent that some of the people who were offsite (and hence had no need of name tags) wanted them.</br> 
			My boss had agreed to pay for the materials but it turned out that the total cost of materials was trivial</br>
			(like $12 for a sheet of plywood with most of it left over -- still cutting on that sheet today)</br>
			so I just ignored it. I think he did pay for the magnets which, ironically, were more expensive than the wood.</p>

			<p>Just a brief note; if you want a name tag of your very own, you should see my etsy store...</p>
