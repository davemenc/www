I wanted to create something unique and compelling and, well, better than Facilities would come up with (petty motives cause us to excel more often than we like to think).','I designed name tags to be cut out of wood for people. I got the (correctly spelled) name of every person in the office and did a custom design for their names.','I had to try a few things. First off, what designs look best in wood? I decide in a script font with the letters unetched and the background etched deeply. The result, eventually, was about 50 wooden name tags. Then the question was, \"How to attache them?\" Ultimately, we ended up gluing very strong magnets to the back and then, on glass, putting other strong magnets on the other side of the glass. On other surfaces we would attache them on some ferrous metal.','Everyone seemed to be very pleased with their name tags even to the extent that some of the people who were offsite (and hence had no need of name tags) wanted them. My boss had agreed to pay for the materials but it turned out that the total cost of materials was trivial (like $12 for a sheet of plywood with most of it left over -- still cutting on that sheet today) so I just ignored it. I think he did pay for the magnets which, ironically, were more expensive than the wood.','https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQBLdBe15UvxJ5Q2o0KlaBC_8NC-k7GCL01YgimPqYLZ8hRQGIqjA','https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS1-ZGH3_Ysch8HWrnAKsOZ8xnlukt75yR2XgefCG3Cijwo-jPlSA','http://nametagpros.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Gold-Auto-Dealer-Name-Tag.jpg','','Just a brief note: if you want a name tag of your very own, you should see my etsy store...',50,1,'2014-09-28 20:07:53'),(3,'Spiral Pendants','Laser','A burning man gift','It is customary at Burning Man for a Camp to give gifts to people who visit them.

It occurred to me that if I cut it out of wood it would make a nice pendant. ','I played around with putting letters on it and that looked pretty nice.

I found these 12 Julia Sets that someone had arranged to make a dodecahedron (12 faced 3 dimensional object). I made 12 little pentagons and cut them out of wood. ','My colleague at work, Ambur, saw this and suggested that it would make a really nice button. So I made some buttons for her out of it.

The buttons were made from the inner hole.',NULL,'','','','','',50,1,'2014-09-28 13:55:40'),(5,'Stands','Laser','Acrylic stand for holding up laser items.','I had been making things out of wood and acrylic for a few months and I wanted to show some of it off. I needed some kind of stand to hold basically flat things vertically.','I had seen -- and even owned -- picture stands that had a straight back and curved up in front forming a sort of pair of curved fingers in front that would hold an object upright. ','It took me a while to figure out how to make this. I finally took an ornate \"J\" from a particular font and modified it so that the back was square instead of curved (the curved one kept falling over backwards). Then I added tabs to the back -- on one the tabs faced up, while on the other they faced down. When I cut them out of acrylic, the tabs fit together perfectly (ok, it didn\'t work on the first one but I got it right eventually) and caused the two \"J\" to stand up at right angles to each other. An object would sit in the curved bottoms of the two \"Js\" and be held upright be the stand. Best of all, because you can take them apart, they can be shipped flat and then assembled.

At the time when I wrote this, Board Game Geek either did not exist or I had not heard of it yet (I think the former because this was a very long time ago -- mid 90s I think). ','I wrote a web site that would display a list of games. The list was in a table and it had some other information in the table. Then, when you clicked on the name of a game, it would show a more detailed description of the game with a large picture and more information.','I had a lot of games and there were complaints that the page took too long to load. Eventually, I created an interface that allowed you to set how many games would be on a page and allowed you to page through the games. EVENTUALLY, I wrote a generalized version of this that allowed you to pass an arbitrary list of items and displayed them with pages and different sorts of sorts.

There must be a hundred applications that do that but I decided that I could do better than any of them. (Arrogance:yet another motivator for greatness, or at least doing something.) The main thing I needed was something that could be access from anywhere. At the time, to be fair, there were no web applications that could do this. And, of course, I <b>LIKE</b> programming.','A web application is the obvious solution. I implemented a password-based security (set a cookie), tasks, categories, and various different views.','It was based on WAMP and had a database that included all the to-do items that had been entered. It was originally designed for one user (that would be me) but for multiple projects. It had no hierarchy (that is, each task belonged to a project but could not, in turn, belong to other tasks), and no due dates. It did have \"priority\" numbers which set the order. It also had some special categories, for example, certain task entries contained notes about using this or that system. I used it for years and added some specialized fields to it. For example, for a time I was responsible for entering every thing I did in the past week and everything I was going to do in the next week into a tracker so I wrote report (a web page) that would generate that report in the appropriate format so I could just cut and paste it into the other system. Eventually I added multiple users and some due date information but that is not how I do things so I never really got that part to work properly.

We hired a huge number of contractors (something like 2 dozen) work on about a dozen projects. Of course, being a huge multinational corporation, there was a complicated system for getting these people paid -- and we kept running out of money. Part of the problem was that it took up to 3 months to get a contract signed but there was also the problem that the Finance department would tell us that we were out of money much sooner than our best estimate suggested. We were constant surprised by this and we assumed that it was because our model was flawed and/or we were not careful enough tracking things.','I wrote an application that tracked the process of getting a contract signed (to try to make it more efficient) and tracked how much we spent on each contract. I trained the group admin in the system so that some of the work was distributed and so that we collaborate.','I used a PHP-based web application. I got the whole thing running, tracking users, invoices, contracts and projects and projecting how much money we had and when we would run out. The project was a marginal success because it allowed us to totally track our money but Finance kept surprising us. It turns out that would routinely pay for invoices from the wrong (at least, different from what we expected) contract. This was the fundamental problem -- we could never tell what, exactly Finance was doing because we did not have access to their accounting system. Eventually, we used data from the invoice tracker to get them to give us access to the real accounting system and then we used our data to correct their data (and, yes, their data to correct our data). Eventually, we got all the systems working together and were never surprised by running out of money.',NULL,'','','','','',50,1,'2014-09-28 14:44:55'),(9,'Company List','Web','A web application to crowd source companies. ','I was out of work and I wanted a list of companies that I could research and try to apply to. I was making list in excel but I wanted a more organized and easily edited approach. Besides, was I the only person who needed this or could the efforts of other people be leveraged? ','I wrote a web app very similar to my game list but, this time, it was a company list. The idea was to make it a sort of wiki. <a href=\"http://menconi.com/companylist/\">Company List</a>','This time I took the game list and automated it. This program is, essentially, a framework. Instead of a routine that opens a database and displays the contents, I wrote a routine that takes a list of stuff (maybe you got it from a database but the routine does not know about that) and displays it, automatically calculating sort parameters and pagination and all the other things require. It works but there were a lot of edge cases, a lot of places where it would break. This experience caused me to explore cake (which is to PHP what rails is to ruby). In the end, although the program worked, in the end I gave up because there were just too many companies out there and too few of them were interesting to me. I was boiling the ocean.

','Again, a web application seemed a good idea. (Yes, I have a tool and I was applying the tool to all my problems but I think they are, by and large, tractable to this particular tool.)','I had already written the company list application so I simply repurposed it to drumming resources. The code worked great but few people found it and fewer people entered anything in it. And the tiny bit of information in it, was inaccurate (or so I was informed) so I shut it down.

','A brilliant friend, Jeffrey Ventrella, showed me that you could do more with genetic algorithms than just solve problems. His <a href=\"http://www.ventrella.com/darwin/darwin.html\">Darwin Pond</a> was a life simulator and several others of his projects demonstrated that they could be used to for aesthetic purposes, as well. I wanted to create something that would be based on a genetic algorithm and allow a crowd to create a beautiful image from a simple algorithm.','I had previously played with the rules to game of life so I used the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CB4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FConway%27s_Game_of_Life&ei=rSMoVLLbPMz8oQSB5oHACA&usg=AFQjCNENBO6oDLVAZkK9pDPEyGPHWzpXbA&sig2=ZwTWeO7FQf9lXbG5AtTF7A\"> Conway Game of Life </a> to generate the images and the genetic algorithms to pick the starting conditions of the game of life.

Initially, I would do this as a web site and then, when it worked properly, take it to Burning Man where people are always wandering around looking for interesting things. ','I used javascript to implement the game of life. Given a starting string, it would put that into the game space and then generate the changes according to the rules of the Game of Life until the user rated it. Then it would send that rating to a PHP backend which would respond with a new starting string. The PHP code would generate the starting strings, keep track of the user ratings (which is the fitness function), mate the strings and decide which string should be sent to the javascript. The whole thing actually worked but it had a rather major problem: it only worked on firefox. That meant that if I put it on the internet, only a fraction (a substantial fraction is still a fraction) of the users would be able to use it.

How hard could it be?','My friend Jeff did most of the actual work, building the electronics around an arduino based package intended for 3D printers plus some stepper motors to run the shaker and 12 pumps originally intended to pump oil out of cars. My contribution was the software. Two problems presented themselves: first, how to do a user interface on a 4x20 LCD display with a little knob as input and, second, how to do figure out what 12 ingredient will make the most, best drinks. ','We decided that we would ask a customer 3 questions and, based on his/her answer, we would mix them the perfect drink. As a backup, I wrote a \"camp menu\" which allows you to look at the whole list of drinks and just pick one. I created a bunch of questions of the \"What is your favorite color?\" variety but carefully constructed to fit in 20 characters (\"Best Color?\") each with 3 to 8 answers to choose from. The user would spin the knob to highlight the answer he wanted and then push the knob in to select it. I gave each answer an arbitrary value and then used the sum of the answers to pick a drink. </p><P>The problem of ingredients was harder. We had a database of drinks (with ingredients) which I had maintained for the Golden Cafe. I added a rating to each of the drinks (based on what we liked and wanted our robot to mix) and then created a genetic algorithm to try to find the 12 ingredients that would make highest value collection of drinks. It worked amazingly well, allowing us to bring a robot about 4 feet tall and 5 feet wide and just a few feet deep to burning man in 2012 that could mix 20 drinks out of 12 ingredients.
