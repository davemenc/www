One of the (many) challenges of going to Burning Man is to find a creative way to get other people to participate in an art project. Sure, you can build a 200 foot high sculpture or blow something up but that's not really PARTICIPATORY, just impressive. Besides, those projects are REALLY EXPENSIVE. How to get someone to participate in the project: that's the trick.[solution]=>As it happened, there was a Facebook site for camps in the 7:30 neighborhood (in Black Rock City, as in any other city, a main street and nearby side streets are called a neighborhood and the main streets have clock times -- 3:00, 4:30, 6:00, 7:30, 9:00) which was the neighborhood our camp was located that year. People on the Facebook page posted a message saying who they were and where they were located in the neighborhood. My idea was to create a set of little sticks -- they look like popsicle sticks -- that had the name and address of each of the camps on them. We would try to entice visitors to take a stick and deliver it to the camp listed on the stick and try to convince someone at that camp to bring it back. The reason this is a good project is because it gets people moving around and interacting with each other. I called them "Destiny Sticks" as in "It is your destiny to go to camp X."[implementation]=>I cut the sticks out of 1/8" plywood and, using the list of camps that I pulled off of Facebook (I created a spreadsheet up on Google Docs and shared with everyone in the neighborhood which got me a minor reputation). We put the sticks in a cup in a prominent location in our camp and did our best to convince every visitor to take a stick and "find their destiny." [result]=>A lot of people took sticks. We don't know who many actually took them to their destination camps but certainly some did and, presumably, someone at the camp accepted the stick and kept it. Imagine how that looks from their end: someone shows up with a custom etched stick with your camp's name on it; you naturally keep it as a souvenir! But there were at least 2 cases where someone from a neighboring camp brought the sticks back, so we know the project as at least marginally successful.
