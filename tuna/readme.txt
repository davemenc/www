Tuna is a web based music management and playing app. It has 3 main goals
1) To be very simple.
2) To be very easy to install.
3) To provide support for multiple users, particularly for rating music (that is my rating is distinct from your rating).

This is version .1

Please find and read the file "installation.txt" which will have the latest installation guide. 

It is assumed that you have WAMP (http://www.wampserver.com/en/) or LAMP installed (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu). 

It is also probably pretty important that you have a lot of privs on your system for things like setting up apache and installing new applications. 

I welcome collaboration. The system is simple so you can "get it" very quickly and it has a LOT of obvious things missing so you can add value easily.

It would be good if you understood how to code in PHP and had at least my grasp of web applications and how their down (which, I'm sorry to say, is not a high bar). You'll probably do fine.

I'm using trello to track what needs to be done but I'm not sure how to easily collaborate on that; look for a "todo.txt" file around here to get a feel for it or ask me for access to trello.
