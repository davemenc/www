Tuna is a web based music management and playing app. It has 3 main goals

1) To be very simple.

2) To be very easy to install.

3) To provide support for multiple users, particularly for rating music (that is my rating is distinct from your rating).

## Version
This is version 0.1

## Installation
Please find and read the file "installation.txt" which will have the latest installation guide. 

## Prerequsites 
It is assumed that you have WAMP (http://www.wampserver.com/en/) or LAMP installed (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu). 

It is also probably pretty important that you have a lot of privs on your system for things like setting up apache and installing new applications. 

## Collaboration
I welcome collaboration. The system is simple so you can "get it" very quickly and it has a LOT of obvious things missing so you can add value easily.

It would be good if you understood how to code in PHP and had at least my grasp of web applications (which, I'm sorry to say, is not a high bar). Jump in; you'll do fine.
