<h1>KeyStore Help page</h1>
This is the help page for the keystore.
<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of the keystore is to (duh) store keys.
<h2>Structure</h2>
There is a list of key names. For each name a key is generated for each day.
Strictly speaking, the key isn't generated until it's requested but that shouldn't matter.
For each name/date pair one key is stored forever. It can be fetched back at any time.
<h2>Syntax</h2>
This is php program. It uses standard php syntax in the url.
https://domainname.com/keystore.php?<param>=<value>&<param>=<value>...
One of the param/value pairs must always be the password (pw=<password>)
One of the param/value pairs will usually be the action (act=<action>)
<h2>Parameters</h2>
There are four parameters that are possible. Depending on the action some may be optional.
<ul>
	<li>act -- name of the action to be taken; if missing help will be assumed
	<li>pw -- password, always required
	<li>date -- the date in YYYY-MM-DD formet; if missing todays date (at the server) will be used
	<li>name -- name of the key; this is required for the fetch and add commands
</ul>
<h2>Actions</h2>

There are 4 actions available :
<ul>
	<li>help -- this help page; the password (pw) is required
	<li>fetch -- get a key; the password (pw) and the name are required; the date defaults to today (at the server); this fetches a key for this name & date; if this key has never been requested before it will be generated, else it will be
	<li>add -- add a name; the password (ps) and the name are required -- this just adds a name to the list
	<li>list --
</ul>
