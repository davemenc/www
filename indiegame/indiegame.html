<h1>Indie Game Developer Conference</h1>


<h2>What Is IndieGame?</h2>
<p>IndieGame will be a conference held to foster intimate ties within the indie game development community and allow individuals to share their experiences with their fellow developers.

<h2>Isn't This Just GDC-Lite?  </h2>
<p>Nope. As one of the founders of the GDC, I believe the strength of the GDC is the support it provides to the game developer industry. However, the same cannot be fully said for the indie community. Indie game development is a distinct, small group, and if I may be so bold as to say- a financially strapped group. Not everyone can afford a $1500 GDC ticket or wants to endure large crowds. IndieGame is meant to be intimate and allow this small community to shine.

<h2>Who is Dave Menconi and Can He Pull This Off?</h2>
<p>In addition to founding GDC 25+ years ago, I have organized the Playstation developer conference for seven years. I have extensive experience in conference management, as well as current knowledge of conference resources in San Francisco.

<h2>How Can You Help?</h2>
<p>While I am something of a conference geek, I am no longer a game developer. IndieGame needs game developers to present their thoughts and experiences to make this work. IndieGame will give you the podium, but you, the developer, must to stand behind it.
<p>If you don't want to speak (and not EVERYONE can speak, to be sure) you can also contribute by helping with the funding and through your attendance. Show up and participate. You’re creative, find a way for your voice be heard. No spectators.

<h2> How Do I Submit A Talk?</h2>
<P>Please propose a tlak by filling out the <a href= menconi.com/indiegame/speak> speaker form</a> -- please, no mysql commands...

<h2>How Do I Donate?</h2>
<P>Please donate money to <a href=indiegogo>on this page</a>.

<h2> How do I register</h2>
<P>Please fill out this <a href=menconi.com/indiegame/register>registration form</a>.

<h2>Details of the conference</h2>
<P>IndieGame 2014 will be a simple conference. The current plan of IndieGame is to hold the conference at the Theatre Room located in the Grand Hyatt. It’s a cross between a lecture hall and movie theater. The room will accommodate 100 people.
<P>IndieGame will start at 9:00 a.m., contain six or seven sessions, and end around 6:00 p.m. There will be a lunch break where attendees will be encouraged to meet a new friend and explore one of the many delicious lunch options. There will be a morning and afternoon break built into the day. Each session will be about an hour.
<P>At this point, IndieGame does not expect to be able to provide a t-shirt, lunch, or other perks in order to keep the cost of the conference down.
<P>IndieGame is open to suggestions or donations specifically to provide these perks.
<P>Remember that this is something new, just starting out.
<h2> Money Money Money</h2>
<P>The math is pretty simple. It has been broken down so you can see what the IndieGame will contain at various levels of fundraising.

<tr><td>Room</td><td>1000</td><td>1</td><td>1000</td><td>1000</td><td>1000</td></tr>
<tr><td>AV</td><td>1000</td><td>1</td><td>1000</td><td>1000</td><td>2000</td></tr>

<P>First off, let me say that I know what you are thinking: "WHAT!? &lt;Something&gt; costs &lt;some amount&gt;!? No way! I'm sure I could do it cheaper than that!"  I get that all the time. Hotels in San Francisco are expensive. I've done this <b>MANY TIMES</b> and I work hard every time to figure out the cheapest/best way. That's not to say that you couldn't actually do better but this is the best *I* can do with the experience I have. So please don't waste our mutual time carping unless you are willing to actually buckle down and figure out how to do it better (because I've already put in that work and this IS my best). Participate, don't speculate.
<P>Note that this is a list of POSSIBLE perks; only the room and AV are currently in my plans. This does not include any consideration about NEXT year. For example, I can do a <em>meeting</em> like this but if I want to do a <em>conference</em> I'm going to need to incorporate to control risks and manage assets and that will cost money. Fortunately, I don't have to get the hotel to do it so I can do it fairly cheaply -- but not for free.
<P>If IndieGame attracts 100 people at the conference who pay $100 (or more) it will generate as much as $10,000. That's enough money to do fund all the perks.

<h2> Final Thoughts</h2>
<P>Welcome to the humble beginning of IndieGame! With your support, IndieGame will grow into a very respectable small conference that will play a significant role in the indie game development community.
